        <h1 class="main-heading">Functional JavaScript</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">JavaScript gives us a lot of freedom.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The freedom to change the type of an initialized variable, for
          example. But also the freedom to try out different paradigms.
          JavaScript doesn't have a fixed paradigm — we can write
          object-oriented, imperative, and even functional code.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          While I see a lot of object-oriented and imperative JS code, the
          latter one seems underestimated. Functional programming isn’t easy —
          and misunderstood.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Time to give a beginner-friendly introduction to this paradigm in
          JavaScript. Here are the main concepts explained. Of course, you won’t
          be turned into a full-fledged functional programmer. But hopefully,
          this introduction will give you the overview and answers to the why
          and how.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article-heading">
          Understanding the Philosophy of Functional Code
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Understanding is essential for applying. And the right motivation
          helps a lot with learning.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Many people think functional programming means writing as many
          functions as possible. I would argue that writing a lot of functions
          is the consequence of functional programming. Let’s demystify it and
          get aware of the goals of this programming paradigm.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Functional programming resolves mainly around expressions. Since
          function calls are expressions, writing functions is essential in
          functional programming. But wait — expressions? What does that mean?
        </p>
        <h3 class="article-sub-heading">Statements and expressions</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Our written code can be divided into two groups: Statements and
          expressions.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          An expression is a syntactic entity that can be evaluated. You can
          imagine an expression as something that returns something when it is
          executed. For example, calling a function that returns something is an
          expression. Also, calling a variable is an expression since we receive
          its value.
        </p>

          alt=""
        />
        <p class="paragraph">
          Statements are typical in the imperative programming paradigm. There
          we have our next word to clarify. The imperative style revolves around
          writing the instructions (statements). Functional programming, on the
          other hand, is about describing our data.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Here is a quick example.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The goal is to receive an array of all the even numbers (2, 4)
          contained in numbers.
        </p>
        <pre class="code-block">
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

let evenNumbers = []
       
for (let i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {
  let number = numbers[i]
       
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    evenNumbers.push(number)
  }
}
       
console.log(evenNumbers)
</pre
        >
        <p class="parapgraph">
          This code is imperative — it only consists of statements and depends
          on mutating data (even a global variable).
